# JainbaiArchitect
I am a Solution Architect with strong experience in designing scalable, secure, and cloud-native enterprise systems. With a solid foundation in application development and distributed systems, I specialize in transforming complex business requirements into resilient, cost-optimized architectures.

I have led solution design initiatives across cloud migration, microservices modernization, data platforms, and AI-driven systems. My focus areas include system scalability, performance optimization, domain-driven design, and aligning technology with business outcomes.
