**A master architect thinks in:**

  Constraints - 
  Trade-offs
  Scalability
  Failure modes
  Cost
  Security
  Business impact

2️⃣ **Master Core Architecture Foundations**
🔹 **A. SOLID + Clean Architecture**

    You must deeply understand:
    
    SOLID principles
    
    Clean Architecture
    
    Hexagonal Architecture
    
    DDD (Domain-Driven Design)
    
    Separation of concerns
    
    👉 Practice: Refactor one of your old projects into Clean Architecture.

🔹 **B. Design Patterns (Beyond Memorizing)**

      Know:
      
      Factory
      
      Strategy
      
      Observer
      
      Adapter
      
      Decorator
      
      Singleton (proper use)
      
      Builder
      
      But more important:
      ✔ When NOT to use them
      ✔ How they solve coupling problems

🔹 **C. System Design Fundamentals**

      Master these concepts:
      
      Scalability (vertical vs horizontal)
      
      Load balancing
      
      Caching (Redis)
      
      Rate limiting
      
      Circuit breaker
      
      Event-driven architecture
      
      Messaging (Kafka / SQS)
      
      CAP theorem
      
      ACID vs BASE
      
      Database sharding
      
      CQRS
      
      If you can explain these clearly, you're strong.

🏗** 3️⃣ Architectural Styles (Very Important)**

      You must know when to choose:
      
      Monolith
      
      Modular monolith
      
      Microservices
      
      Event-driven architecture
      
      Serverless architecture
      
      Layered architecture
      
      Clean architecture
      
      Hexagonal architecture
      
      Master = knowing trade-offs.
      
      Example:
      Microservices = flexibility + complexity
      Monolith = simplicity + scaling limits

☁️** 4️⃣ Cloud Architecture Mastery**

      Since you work in Java + Cloud:
      
      You must design:
      
      High availability systems
      
      Auto scaling
      
      Disaster recovery
      
      Multi-region deployment
      
      Observability (logs, metrics, tracing)
      
      CI/CD pipelines
      
      Security architecture (IAM, zero trust)
      
      Be able to draw:
      
      User → CDN → Load Balancer → App → Cache → DB → Monitoring

🔥** 5️⃣ Performance & Scalability Thinking**

      You should confidently answer:
      
      How to handle 10 million users?
      
      How to reduce DB bottleneck?
      
      How to scale read-heavy system?
      
      How to design low-latency API?
      
      Master these:
      
      Caching layers
      
      Read replicas
      
      Async processing
      
      Queue-based architecture
      
      Batch vs streaming

**🔐 6️⃣ Security Architecture**

      Many architects are weak here.
      
      Learn:
      
      OAuth2 / JWT
      
      API Gateway security
      
      Encryption at rest/in transit
      
      Secret management
      
      Threat modeling
      
      OWASP Top 10
      
      Zero Trust Architecture

🧠 **7️⃣ Documentation & Diagram Mastery**

      You should produce:
      
      C4 diagrams
      
      Sequence diagrams
      
      Deployment diagrams
      
      Data flow diagrams
      
      Threat model diagrams
      
      Infrastructure diagrams
